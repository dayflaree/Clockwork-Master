|IRiS| Cookie: You let Woodfin be a raider?
Otoris: I never gave him the flag
Otoris: I don't believe...
Otoris: I think I only gave teh radier flag to Haunted
|IRiS| Cookie: He says you told him he could be a raider..lol
Otoris: I don't remember that
|IRiS| Cookie: Evilferret says you let him join the enclave
Otoris: Evilferret....As a resident in the vault, not as a full member
|IRiS| Cookie: Was that just for a bit of RP, or forever
Otoris: Bit of RP
|IRiS| Cookie: Then I need to have a chat with both of em
|IRiS| Cookie: thanks
Otoris: I didn't notice Waffles had setup Enclave stuff so there maybe other hired Enclave. D:
|IRiS| Cookie: lol
|IRiS| Cookie: ill yell at the others too
Otoris: One other thing, I only picked the top role-players to be Enclave while I was not knowing of Waffles Enclave stuff. :D
|IRiS| Cookie: lol
|IRiS| Cookie: Ill watch em then
Otoris: Also, have you granted anyone any tooltrusts since you created your new system for administering them?
|IRiS| Cookie: Nope.
|IRiS| Cookie: I havnt really been looking for it though
Otoris: Here is a suggestion for a TT, SPC.moh556=US= in game character is Lucy Mclury, outstanding role-player as far as I am concerned and as far as I know, this person has never been banned, kicked, asked for TT or Flags, and has a very good record
|IRiS| Cookie: Yea. Ill watch him while im RPing now, he is in here
Otoris is now playing Garry's Mod. Click here to join.
|IRiS| Cookie: Basically
|IRiS| Cookie: The NERD RAGE Perk
|IRiS| Cookie: Will be activated for 20 Seconds when your health drops to 20% or below
|IRiS| Cookie: Once it is activated, it only works for 20 seconds, then the effects go away.
|IRiS| Cookie: And it cannot be used for 30 minutes, even if your hp goes below 20%
Otoris: Right, but wouldn't you want the player to choose to activate it?
Otoris: Or is having it activate automatically fine?
|IRiS| Cookie: Could you make it so the player can choose that?
|IRiS| Cookie: Once they get the Perk, they can choose if they want it activated manually or automatically
Otoris: Sure,
Otoris: How would they activate it manually, like through a chat command or button?
|IRiS| Cookie: Button
|IRiS| Cookie: Wait
|IRiS| Cookie: Could you make both?
Otoris: Of course! :D
|IRiS| Cookie: Then do both <3
Otoris: How bout a button on the hud, like right under the ID card? You would hold tab to click it
|IRiS| Cookie: How bout "/enable nerdrage" or somethin lol
|IRiS| Cookie: Sure, that would be sekzie
