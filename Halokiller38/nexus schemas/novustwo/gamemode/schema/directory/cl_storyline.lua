	2029. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has suffered a massive blow after the Russian Federation's attack on the Georgian capital, T'bilisi. N.A.T.O. forces were
	deployed to battle and fight off the invaders in Georgia, and failed miserably in all attempts to retake its capital. The Russian Federation grows by another 69,700 square
	kilometers. After retreating, N.A.T.O. was left in pieces. N.A.T.O. loses the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway over the conflict.

	The middle east's 20 year 'war on terror' campaign has left most of the U.S.'s military forces weakened and small, lacking recruits. After much hassle and attempts to
	do so, the U.S. passes a conscription act, forcing all individuals- 1 week after their 18th birthday- to pack up join the U.S. National Guard. This, however, causes mass
	riots, outrage, and hysteria to break out amongst the people. None of them are prepared to join the National Guard, and barely any want to. A new war breaks out within
	the U.S., pitting the National Guard and U.S. civilian rebels against each other. For the first time in almost 164 years, the U.S. is at civil war.

	The world's population is growing, fast. Less and less area is becoming inhabitable for human life, and the U.N. begins a massive project to fix this problem.
	After collecting tons of funding from donators and countries in the U.N., they begin to construct massive apartment blocks throughout the vast New Mexico deserts.
	Over 11,000 are hastily built, leaving almost all of them not fully constructed. Without any more funds, they are left alone, a failed project costing over 25.8 billion dollars.

	What survived of al-Qaeda has made a comeback in Afganistan. Their leader- Usamah bin Mu?ammad bin `Awa? bin Ladin (Also known as Osama bin Laden.) orders a massive
	bio-terrorism attack on the U.S. and the U.K. during their time of weakness and conflict. Within days, a group of 3 smallpox-infected al-Qaeda loyalist men are sent
	into the U.S.. One is sent to Brooklyn, New York. Another is sent to Indianapolis, Indiana. And the third one is sent to San Diego, California. Within 2 weeks
	almost 3 quarters of the U.S.'s population is infected, wiping out over 210,000,000 people. The world is in panic- smallpox vaccinations are hastily made and spread
	out amongst central Europe and Asia. Riots and chaos break out at the distribution centers as they struggle to evenly spread them out. The second troop of infected
	al-Qaedamen are sent to London, where they infect and kill over 48 million people in a matter of weeks.
	<br><br>
	With the massive success of the two attacks, the world is left in fear as the virus continues to spread to other countries by those infected/not infected who were carrying
	the disease to other countries. Quarantines are issued in all of eastern Europe and western Asian nations. Powerful government officials - including the president - had
	become infected and killed within the chaos. The men fighting in the U.S. Civil War of 2029 have been issued SOME vaccinations. They continue to fight, but are rarely seen
	fighting as much as before the outbreak. Survivors struggle to piece back together what was once their government, while groups of powerful U.S. military and governmental
	figures and their families group of about 40 thousand or so in a large, well hidden area within (Rumored, but not confirmed to the people of the wasteland.) the Appalachian
	mountains, separated from the chaotic world outside.
	<br><br>
	National Guardsmen receive orders from the Appalachian forts to be vaccinated and head for the Appalachian bases as soon as possible. Groups of rogue soldiers abandon
	their orders, and make a living scavenging and salvaging what they can of what's left of the U.S. and their survivors. Currently they are at an alliance against
	the U.S. Civilian Insurgent Militia Force who have, since the first six months of fighting against the National Guard, become a much more organized and powerful force.
	The population of the U.S. now dwindles at a mere 5,000,000 or so, which is, nearly, one sixth of California's once 30 million population. Most of the survivors have joined
	the U.S. Insurgent Militia, while the rest fend for themselves in small groups or factions. Survivors are spread throughout the U.S., the largest concentration being plotted
	in New Mexico, the last operational vaccination site in the North America region.
	<br><br>
	Two years have passed since the National Guard have been given their orders. Not much has changed. Less patrol the populated areas of the wastes, while the rest live peacefully
	in the Appalachians. Bandits, raiders, groups of militiamen, National Guard, and lone survivors dot 2 areas: New Mexico, and West Virginia. The effects of global warming, after
	much years of buildup, ware and destroy most of the buildings and remnants of civilization without anybody to repair or sustain them. Massive climate changes come into effect
	throughout North America and South America. Torrential rain, snow, and solar wind/dust storms sweep across northern America. Conditions are tough and unrelenting. Freezing
	nights and scorching hot days in New Mexico, cold, hard conditions in and around West Virginia.
	<br><br>
	The year is now 2032. Present day. You are in the inner parts of New Mexico, struggling to survive and not get raided or mugged every day. You are a survivor- that means
	you're completely immune to smallpox and have the survival skills necessary to have lived without civilization for over 3 years. You and your fellow survivors are what's
	left of humanity. May your death be quick and painless.
