I.
After three years of recruitment and training, the Enclave have finally expanded West. Several researchers based in the Enclave's internal division have concluded that the Enclave forces moving West are over 50% of the Enclave's military. Due to this, the East has almost no "law", so to speak; handfuls of authorities have formed in the Enclave's absence to try to keep the wastes as safe as possible, however. In a belief similar to Manifest Destiny, the Enclave have begun conquering all south-western waste areas. Wastelanders have begun calling this "The Death March".  The Enclave have even gone to the point where anyone in their path will be killed; many compare this to the Indian Wars on the American frontier. Now, in an effort to stop this massive March, the Brotherhood of Steel and New California Republic have agreed to a temporary cease fire until every last Enclave soldier is killed..

II.
The New California Republic has expanded Eastward in Nevada. Instead of moving from coast to coast, small settlements have entered the wastes far into the outskirts of the New Vegas area. Unfortunately, the Enclave's Death March was unexpected by the NCR, not connected to Eastern communication lines. Due to this, the NCR camps on the outskirts of  New Vegas are under constant attack by Enclave forces. The Brotherhood of Steel, realising that siding with the NCR and destroying the Enclave could be beneficial to technological advancement, jumped on the offer. NCR reinforcements, as of 2281, have not arrived to support their brethren in need of assistance.

III.
The Mojave Brotherhood of Steel has stayed the way they have always been: secretive and almost non-existent. Guided by the Brotherhood's constant need of technological advancement, they have agreed to a cease-fire with the NCR; part of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood's constant need for new technology and repair mechanisms.

IV.
The Desert Rangers have always been a mysterious faction. Today's Desert Rangers are part of the few who simply refused to merge with the NCR Rangers. Due to this, these Rangers are often caught up in arguments or even small fights with the New California Republic. Despite this division between the two factions, the Desert Rangers operate as a law in a lawless land; they often patrol the wastes looking for wastelanders in trouble or needing help. In a nutshell, the Desert Rangers are simply police - they even use pre-war riot armour.
