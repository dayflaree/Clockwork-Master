Diary Entry #42.

I'm not sure how much longer I can last. The only thing keeping me
alive, and from going insane from staring at the same walls, day in
and day out, are my diary entries. Without them, I'd be lost. I only
write them in the hope that they might make it further than I do,
before the sides of my mind collapse in on themselves. I feel them
closing in every day, like a piece of trash under a crusher.

I suppose that I had better explain my time here, and what has led
me to this insanity. To those who are reading this, this is the story
of how I tried to find salvation. How my hopes and dreams were crushed
before my very eyes. How my mind won't last another week. This is the
story... of how I died.

It may have been a month ago, it may have been several. For all intents
and purposes, it could have been a lifetime ago. My time in this city
was sorely spent, looking for ways to try and make the days a little
less painful. Make me feel a little more human. Every meal I consumed
felt as if my mind was escaping my body, attempting to leave the pained,
battered flesh and bone behind.

A simple but reliable source explained to me the way to escape, contacts
that could guide me away from the pain... the suffering... the death...
One long corridor after another, only
