	This plugin allows you to add / remove / modify ranks, divisions, and their models. You may set a model that only applies for i5 UNION's. You could make every DvL look different, etc. It also allows you to change the name of the entire MPF on the scoreboard, and change the default recruit name from MPF.RCT.* to CCA.RCT.*, etc. The same goes for OTA.
