# Clockwork Master
This is the master repository for Clockwork frameworks, schemas, plugins etc. Nearly everything 'Clockwork' can be found here. Additionally there are some miscellaneous gamemodes and schemas such as Nutscript.

**Information**

The Clockwork Framework is not beginner-friendly and requires a solid understanding of programming, particularly in Lua, the scripting language used by Garry's Mod. If you're new to development, itâ€™s recommended to familiarize yourself with the basics of Lua before diving into Clockwork.
