Within the Union-provided sanctuaries, numerous sinister cacodemons provl in an effort to deceive, exploit and cause
suffering upon civilians within various cities, bolstered by malleable, susceptible beings who succumb to their
treachery like adolescent children possessing their antagonistic sentiments directed towards their loving progenitors,
who would cradle their children despite the circumstances. I experience petrification when meeting these foul,
twisted abominations who feed on the misery and anguish of the liberated civilians residing in Union-appointed
sanctuaries, oppressed by their peers in dismal, dilapidated areas not fit for man.

Despite the detestable methodology these abominations use to lure credulous beings in, they often deceive
themselves in order to justify their actions, subsequently retaining their deluded sanity. The Universal Union-appointed
often attempts to resolve these constant acts of frivolous rebellion in civilised, compassionate manners yet
are invariably met with obstinateness and hostility. Altering these demons is impracticable and approaching them will
inevitably cause your death, thus making it advisable you remain in the sanctuaries provided by your loving benefactors.

Remain unassailable; do not banish your asylum.
