What does it take to be a true citizen?
The question has been raised several times previously so I created a guide to enlighten citizens.
The remarks of true citizens are displayed everywhere in the city from posters to annoucements but few know it's real meaning.
I am confident that this guide will help serve you precariously through the long run so it is best to keep this as a mental note.

The True Citizen has a supplement of basic traits that are beneficial within the Universal Union.
They know to respect their benefactors and give them the utmost confidence of what they bring to society.
True citizens always keep their identification armband shown at all times in order to bring organization within themselves.
They work the hardest out of all the other groups and also have strong loyalty to their collagues and peers.

The True Citizens always conserve valuable oxygen in order to keep the resource from depleting for the rest of the population.
The True Citizens respects the accommodations they are given from the Universal Union.
The True Citizens do not hold onto materialistic possessions as they delay progression to immortality.
The True Citizens always report with discretion on what they feel is not beneficial to the progress of the Union.

The only way to know that you have attained this status is by working hard and remaining loyal to your subjects.
Believe in yourself that you can strive to meet these goals and only then will you know that immortality is imminent.
Be sure always to treat this book as a guide to enlightment through hardwork and perseverance in this industrial landscape.
