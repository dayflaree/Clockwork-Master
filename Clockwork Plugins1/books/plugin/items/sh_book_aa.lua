Antlions are social creatures living in large underground colonies. They are blind and use pheromones and vibrations to identify other living beings.
They come in several types, some of which are separate castes. Five have been observed so far: Soldiers, Workers, Grubs, Guards, and Guardians.

The Grubs resemble Earthly insect larvae, with soft, translucent bodies and underdeveloped limbs. They also have small mouths that open and close slowly.
They emit a high chirping call and bioluminescence similar to that of a Firefly. They are found only deep inside Antlion colonies, and can be seen hanging
on any available surfaces, often in groups of two or more. They are extremely fragile and can be killed by merely bumping into them. In the hive, human
remains are sometimes found scattered on the ground near Grubs, suggesting that they are carnivorous and are presumably provided with food by mature Antlions.
Grubs also exude a filmy thread, similar to that of a Silkworm but on a much larger scale. As seen in various caves, these webs often block whole passageways
or contain supplies left over from deceased humans. Every Antlion in the nest will protect grubs fiercely. These grubs, however, produce viscous, chunky
nuggets of some unknown material that has excellent painkilling properties, though the healing effect will fade in time.

The Antlion Soldier is a four-legged insectoid creature around 3 to 5 feet in height and 6 feet in length. Their legs are arranged oddly, with their back
legs set at their front, and vice versa. Their hard shells are mostly green with stripes of tan, yellow, purple and red. They have no visible eyes, and
have three mouth-parts arranged in a triangle on their face. Hidden beneath the Antlions' shells are wings which allow it to fly several feet in the air,
making a loud buzzing noise as they take to the air. They are also quite powerful burrowers, able to tunnel through solid rock and even concrete.

Like regular Antlions, Workers can fly short distances; however, their wings are smaller, therefore Workers cannot fly as far as regular Antlions. Antlion workers
primarily attack by hurling 'spitballs' of acidic neurotoxin at foes from a distance with great accuracy, similar to Bullsquids. If caught up close they will
attack with their claws, but they usually prefer to use their more powerful ranged attack and will often retreat if their attacker gets too close. These factors
combine to make the Antlion worker an uncommonly standoffish foe. When killed, Antlion Workers explode in a shower of acid inflicting considerable splash damage
on anything within range. Thumpers do not stop the Antlion Workers, as the Workers can still fire their spitballs when attacking. It is recommended to kill the
Workers before attacking the Soldiers, or to steer clear of the area entirely.

Antlion Guards, known to Vortigaunts as "Myrmidonts", resemble a considerably larger and more powerful Antlion, with a similar skin color and insectoid features.
The most differentiating feature, by far, is the Guard's protected carapace, which acts as both a battering ram and a deadly weapon. Their dark-red tint and radiant
blue "feathers" which adorn its back make it clearly distinguishable. Much like a rhino from Earth, the Antlion Guard is able to bash into objects with great force
in a combination charging head-butt attack, thanks to its size. The power of the Antlion Guards' strikes can easily knock aside anything or anyone unfortunate enough
to be in their way. When they confront threats, they often try to strike them with their heads, but have been observed utilizing environmental objects as projectiles
by ramming them with full velocity. Antlion Guards can take a lot of damage, and it normally requires a large amount of damage to bring one down. Antlion Guards are
known to smash through walls and even fellow Antlions to kill enemies it is pursuing.

Antlion Guardians appear physically identical to Antlion Guards, but have a different coloration and are capable of bioluminescence. Apparently, each Antlion hive has
one Guardian that lurks near the larval clusters. The Guardian patrols the "Nectarium", or center of the nest, keeping watch for nest raiders. Guardians are extremely
protective of Antlion Grubs, the extract of which is used by Vortigaunts to manipulate the Vortessence, and will ferociously attack intruders in order to protect them.
It is notable that the Guardian is very similar to the Guard, both in name and appearance, but there are numerous differences: the Guardian often lives deeper within
the nests, protecting and ruling over the Antlions and eggs within. Comparatively, the Guard will work closer to the surface, protecting nest entrances, and offering
backup for workers. Also notable is the Guardian's natural bioluminescence, which is presumably caused by it living in deeper darkness. The Guardian also has a very
different coloration, consisting of more varied and contrasting colors.

Antlion Soldiers are the most visible element of Antlion society, most of which is kept hidden in fiercely defended underground nests. It is not clear how
Antlions breed; Vortigaunts have been heard referring to a "spawning season" at the beginning of the Fall months, but whether Antlions mate separately, have
a queen/drone system or practice something completely alien to Earth sensibilities is not known. Their young begin life as larvae in blue honeycombs similar to
those of bees. The extract of these larvae is highly prized by the Vortigaunts for its ability to "divide the false veils of the vortessence" when imbibed.
This seems to augment their natural abilities. It should be noted that such retrieval is difficult at best due to fierce opposition to the so-called "hive robbers".

Antlions were once farmed by Vortigaunts for their larval extract and a number of other purposes, possibly on their homeworld. Since the Combine invasion of Earth
and the beginning of the Portal Storms the Antlions have established themselves on Earth. They have obviously been very successful in doing so, possibly to the point
of causing extinction to other kinds of Earth fauna. So widespread were the Antlions on Earth that the Combine had to install a large network of Thumpers around key
strategic areas to prevent infestation. Should these Thumpers, large rhythmically-pounding devices which overload the senses of Antlions, be shut down, chaos will ensue.
