This is a fix of the original version released. This fixes the theme issues, as well as various others. CAX has been removed from this version of Clockwork.

The new cl_theme must be put into your schema folder.

Gamemode name, author, etc. can be edited in sh_boot.lua
Please remember to give credit to Alex Grist.

Thanks.
